    <h1>Welcome to the R.E.D.</h1>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">We strive to make the management of Canadian projects well.. More manageable!</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">It is important to track infrastructure in Canada so that everyone is informed about the status of projects, and if there are any problems such as budget. It would be crucial to have a centralized database for all projects to see any common issues between projects across a city, province, or the whole country to improve the efficiency of work all.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
      When there multiple projects going at once, quickly being able to see who is working on each project is helpful!

    </p>
    <ul>Our main goals are to have all information on every documented project easily accessable to everyone. This includes, but is not limited to:</ul>
    <li>Management of funds</li>
    <li>Allocation of funds</li>
    <li>Proper accountability</li>
